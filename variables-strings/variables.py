# * Variables!
# ?  A variable in python is a named SYMBOL that holds VALUE
# ? In other words, just a way to STORE DATA
# ? x = 666
# ? khaleesi_mother_of_dragons = 1

# * Variable Reassignment
# ? Variables can be reassigned at anytime!

python_is_awesome = 5
another_variable = python_is_awesome
python_is_awesome = 1000

print(another_variable) # prints 5

# * Multiple Variable Assignment
# ? In python, you can assign multiple variables at once! 

all, at, once = 5, 10, 15 

print(all, at) # prints 5 10

# * Variable Naming Restrictions
# ? Variables must start with a LETTER or UNDERSCORE
# ? ✅ _cats ❌ 2cats

# ? Variables are also CASE SENSITIVE
# ? CATS !== cats

# ? Generally, Variables are written in SNAKE CASE in python NOT CAMEL CASE like JS
# ? ✅ cats_are_cute ❌ catsAreCute

# ? Constants are written in SCREAMING SNAKE CASE
# ? SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE 

# ? Classes are written in UPPER CAMEL CASE (Title case?)
# ? UpperCamelCase

# ? Variables that are not meant to be touched are written with DUNDERS
# ? __do_not_touch__
