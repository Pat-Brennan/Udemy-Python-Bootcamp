# * Modules!

# * Why use modules?
# ? Keep Python files small
# ? reuse code across multiple files by IMPORTING
# ? A Module is just a Python file!

# ? Modules are not used all the time, that's why they're not in the base python code!

# * Custom Modules
# ? You can IMPORT from your own code too!
# ? The syntax is the same as before!
# ? import from THE NAME of the python file

# * External Modules
# ? External Modules are downloaded from the internet!
# ? You can downlaod external modules using PIP

# * pip!
# ? package management system in python
# ? python3 -m pip install Name_of_Package_here
