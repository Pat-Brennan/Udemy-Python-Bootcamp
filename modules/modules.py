# * Modules!

# * Why use modules? 
# ? Keep Python files small
# ? reuse code across multiple files by IMPORTING
# ? A Module is just a Python file!

# ? Modules are not used all the time, that's why they're not in the base python code!

# * Custom Modules
# ? You can IMPORT from your own code too!
# ? The syntax is the same as before!
# ? import from THE NAME of the python file
