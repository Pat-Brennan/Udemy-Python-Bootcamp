# * OOP! : Object Oriented Programming
# ! OOP is NOT unique to Python!
# ? OOP is  a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing ->
# ? in the world as a CLASS or OBJECT.

# * What is a CLASS?
# ? A blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods (functions) ->
# ? and attributes(similar to keys in a dict)

# * What is an INSTANCE?
# ? Objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contains their class's ->
# ? methods and properties.

# * Why OOP?
# ? With object oriented programming, the goal is to encapsulate your code into ->
# ? LOGICAL, HIERARCHICAL groupings using classes so that you can reason ->
# ? about your code at a higher level.
