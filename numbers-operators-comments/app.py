# * Numbers

# ? Integer(int): A whole number. Takes up less memory than a FLOAT

from __future__ import division


print(type(6))  # <class 'int'>

# ? Floating Point(float): A number with a decimal point

print(type(6.66))  # <class 'float'>

# ? If any part of equation is float, the solution will be float

print(1 + 1.0)  # 2.0

# ! However, you CANNOT do this with strings!

print(1 + "2")  # this will throw a TYPE ERROR

# * COMMON OPERATORS
# + Addition
# - Subtraction
# * Multiplication
# / Division
# ** Exponentiation
# % Modulo
# // integer Division

# ? In Python, Division will always give you a FLOAT back
# ? even if they both start as INT's

print(1 / 2)  # 0.5
